Important Concepts for AWS VPC Networking
1. CIDR, Private vs. Public IP
      CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):
      Defines the IP address range for your VPC and subnets (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
      Smaller subnets can be created from the VPC CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24).
      Public IP: Accessible over the internet.
      Private IP: Internal communication only; not internet-accessible.
2. Default VPC
      Comes pre-configured in each region.
      All subnets in the default VPC are public and have an internet gateway attached.
3. Custom VPC
      Allows you to configure subnets, route tables, gateways, and security rules.
      Use when you need precise control over networking.
4. Subnets
      Public Subnet: Traffic routed to the internet gateway.
      Private Subnet: No direct internet access; uses NAT Gateway/Instance for outbound traffic.
5. Internet Gateway & Route Tables
      Internet Gateway (IGW): Enables internet access for resources in a public subnet.
      Route Tables: Define where network traffic is directed (e.g., to IGW, NAT, or VPC Peering).
6. Bastion Hosts
      Used to securely access private instances in a private subnet via SSH/RDP.
      Placed in a public subnet.
7. NAT (Network Address Translation)
      NAT Gateway: Highly available and managed by AWS; for outbound traffic from private subnets.
      NAT Instance: EC2 instance acting as a NAT device; requires manual management.
8. Security Groups and NACLs
      Security Groups: Instance-level firewall; stateful (allows return traffic by default).
      NACLs (Network ACLs): Subnet-level firewall; stateless (return traffic must be explicitly allowed).
9. VPC Peering
      Connects two VPCs privately using private IPs.
      Peered VPCs must not have overlapping CIDR blocks.
10. VPC Endpoints
      Private connection to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) without using the internet.
      Types:
      Gateway Endpoint: For S3 and DynamoDB.
      Interface Endpoint: Uses Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs).
11. VPC Flow Logs
      Capture network traffic logs for analysis.
      Useful for troubleshooting and security audits.
12. Site-to-Site VPN
      Securely connects an on-premises data center to your VPC over the internet.
      Requires a Virtual Private Gateway and a Customer Gateway.
13. Direct Connect (DX)
      Dedicated network connection between your on-premises data center and AWS.
      Offers higher bandwidth and lower latency compared to a VPN.
14. Transit Gateway
      Central hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
      Simplifies complex network architectures.
15. IPv6 in VPC
      VPCs support both IPv4 and IPv6.
      IPv6 addresses are globally unique and routable.
16. Egress-Only Internet Gateway
      Provides IPv6 resources in a VPC with outbound-only internet access.

Exam Tips
            Understand Networking Components:
            
            Know the purpose and differences between IGW, NAT Gateway, NAT Instance, and Egress-only IGW.
            Familiarize yourself with route table configurations and CIDR block rules.
            Practice Subnetting:
            
            Understand how to divide a CIDR block into subnets.
            Know the implications of assigning public/private subnets.
            VPC Connectivity:
            
            Study VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, and VPN configurations.
            Understand when to use Direct Connect vs. VPN.
            Security Best Practices:
            
            Always secure private instances with security groups and bastion hosts.
            Learn the differences between stateful (Security Groups) and stateless (NACLs).
            VPC Endpoints:
            
            Know the difference between Gateway and Interface endpoints and their use cases.
            Hands-On Labs:

            Practice creating a VPC, setting up subnets, NAT Gateway, and Security Groups.
            Configure a site-to-site VPN and test connectivity.
            Troubleshooting:
            
            Use VPC Flow Logs and CloudWatch for diagnosing networking issues.
            Networking Costs:
            Understand data transfer costs between AZs, VPCs, and on-premises networks.


 Key Hands-On Labs to Perform
            Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
            Set up an Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway.
            Configure Security Groups and NACLs for various use cases.
            Test VPC Peering and Transit Gateway connectivity.
            Use a Bastion Host to access private resources.
            Configure and analyze VPC Flow Logs.
Quick Reference for the Exam
            Default VPC: Fully managed; all subnets are public.
            Custom VPC: Greater control over resources and networking.
            NAT Gateway vs. NAT Instance: Use NAT Gateway for scalability and ease of management.
            Security Groups: Stateful; specific to instances.
            NACLs: Stateless; applied to subnets.
            VPC Peering: No transitive peering; must configure route tables manually.
            Transit Gateway: Simplifies VPC-to-VPC and on-premises connectivity.
            Direct Connect: Use for high-bandwidth, low-latency connections to AWS.

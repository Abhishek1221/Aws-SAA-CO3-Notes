Important Concepts for AWS VPC Networking
1. CIDR, Private vs. Public IP
      CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):
      Defines the IP address range for your VPC and subnets (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
      Smaller subnets can be created from the VPC CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24).
      Public IP: Accessible over the internet.
      Private IP: Internal communication only; not internet-accessible.
2. Default VPC
      Comes pre-configured in each region.
      All subnets in the default VPC are public and have an internet gateway attached.
3. Custom VPC
      Allows you to configure subnets, route tables, gateways, and security rules.
      Use when you need precise control over networking.
4. Subnets
      Public Subnet: Traffic routed to the internet gateway.
      Private Subnet: No direct internet access; uses NAT Gateway/Instance for outbound traffic.
5. Internet Gateway & Route Tables
      Internet Gateway (IGW): Enables internet access for resources in a public subnet.
      Route Tables: Define where network traffic is directed (e.g., to IGW, NAT, or VPC Peering).
6. Bastion Hosts
      Used to securely access private instances in a private subnet via SSH/RDP.
      Placed in a public subnet.
7. NAT (Network Address Translation)
      NAT Gateway: Highly available and managed by AWS; for outbound traffic from private subnets.
      NAT Instance: EC2 instance acting as a NAT device; requires manual management.
8. Security Groups and NACLs
      Security Groups: Instance-level firewall; stateful (allows return traffic by default).
      NACLs (Network ACLs): Subnet-level firewall; stateless (return traffic must be explicitly allowed).
9. VPC Peering
      Connects two VPCs privately using private IPs.
      Peered VPCs must not have overlapping CIDR blocks.
10. VPC Endpoints
      Private connection to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) without using the internet.
      Types:
      Gateway Endpoint: For S3 and DynamoDB.
      Interface Endpoint: Uses Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs).

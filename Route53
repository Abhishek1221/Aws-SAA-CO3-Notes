Route 53 Features to Remember
1. Record Types
    A Record: Maps domain to IPv4 address.
    CNAME: Maps a domain to another domain (e.g., alias.example.com â†’ example.com).
    Alias Record: Similar to CNAME but integrates with AWS resources (e.g., ELB, CloudFront).
2. TTL (Time-to-Live)
    Controls how long DNS resolvers cache a record.
    Lower TTL: Faster propagation for changes, but more requests.
    Higher TTL: Reduces DNS query load, slower updates.
3. Routing Policies
Policy	Description	Example Use Case
      Simple	Default policy, one record per domain name.	Single server hosting a website.
      Weighted	Divides traffic based on assigned weights.	Canary deployments, load balancing.
      Latency	Routes traffic to the region with the lowest latency.	Global apps with regional servers.
      Failover	Routes traffic to a healthy endpoint when the primary endpoint fails.	High availability for critical apps.
          Geolocation	Routes based on the user's location.	Localized content or compliance needs.
    Geoproximity	Routes based on proximity and bias (expanding/reducing service areas).	Region-specific optimizations.
    Multi-value	Returns multiple healthy records; supports DNS-based load balancing.	Load balancing across multiple servers.
    IP-Based	Routes traffic based on user IPs.	Tailored IP-based routing solutions.
4. Health Checks
    Monitor endpoint health (HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP).
    Automatic failover when an endpoint is unhealthy.
    Health checks include CloudWatch metrics integration.
5. Domain Registration
    Supports domain registration directly in Route 53.
    Manage DNS records for AWS and third-party domains.
